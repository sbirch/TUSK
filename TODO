TODO:

Re-organize
========
* Split visual_parse to a seperate module
* Split rewriter to a seperate module?
* Convert activity extraction to use pdfminer/visual_parse
* Have specific directory for building a database & lexicon/dicts
* Clean out dead code / move analysis code out
* Make pip-installable

Well-defined features
=======================
* Inflation-adjustment for money
* Additional appendicies (FIPS state code, Census industry data, etc.)
* Caching
* null-code -1 values when someone is outside the edited universe?
* Ambiguous name errors, e.g. OperationalError: (OperationalError) ambiguous column name: TUFNWGTP u'SELECT TEAGE AS age, weighted_avg(TRTFAMILY, TUFNWGTP) FROM (atusresp_0312 inner join atussum_0312 on atussum_0312.TUCASEID=atusresp_0312.TUCASEID) GROUP BY TEAGE;'
* Didn't include the right tables errors, e.g. no such column: PRNMCHLD u'SELECT\n\tTEAGE AS age, weighted_avg(TRTFAMILY, atusresp_0312.TUFNWGTP)\n\tFROM (atusresp_0312 inner join atussum_0312 on atussum_0312.TUCASEID=atusresp_0312.TUCASEID) where PRNMCHLD=0 GROUP BY TEAGE;'
* Extraction tool (to CSV or JSON from query)
* Include example data-points / records in the documentation
* Automatically suggest filing an issue on Github from traceback
* Convert asserts to more meaningful errors
* Rewriter can use schema for auto-join and possibly ambiguous column name/no such
column errors.
* Should be able to add (& remove?) tables

Bugs
======
* Implications of HUSPNISH for database creation (“01” not same as “1” -- currently cast to * integer)
* 181302 seems to be missing from the activity lexicon?
* Can't do AS in user queries
(try: select age, weighted_avg(family_time, respondents.weight) as avg_famtime from respondent_link(respondents, summary) group by age)
* Column keys come back weird (appears to be a SQLAlchemy problem) (e.g. {u'age': 15, u'TUFNWGTP)': 268.2146638993414})
